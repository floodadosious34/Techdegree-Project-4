# Project 4
I added JS code to create a random quote generator in a web application. I based the qoutes off of musicians and artists. I followed the instructions and made it to meet and exceed all expecatations.

## Features Include
1. A random qoute is generated in the html on every button click.
2. The background color is changed on every button click.
3. The random qoute is generated every 10 seconds even if the button is not clicked.
4. Each object has a quote and source property.
5. Some object have an additonal citation, year, and genre property.
6. There is a printQuote function that uses if statements to check for the additional properties.
